	<p>I first watched Attack on Titan in December 2018, and back then, I did not know much about anime or manga and I did not have any specific interests in it either. However, one day when I walked past my living room, I saw my dad watching it, so I went to see what it was about, out of curiousity. My mind was blown away at the amazing animation presented through the ODMG fighting scenes and it immediately intrigued me. When I searched it up online to learn more about the show, I was fascinated by the concept and the story, so I decided to try watching it. It became my favourite anime and it led to me starting to watch other anime as well, and read manga too. One of the most favourable parts of the anime was the music, in which many genres of music including orchestral, opera, rock, and classical was used in the original soundtracks, especially songs such as Vogel im Kafig, Jiyuu no Tsubasa, Guren no Yumiya, and Shinzou wo Sasageyo. In addition, the incredible animation, scenery, and the ways every scene was presented frequently gave me goosebumps. Also, the voice acting was extremely impressive as I could feel the emotion of the characters through their voices, such as Armin's scream, and Eren's vow to kill the titans. In conclusion, this anime was the first anime that I watched that led me to watching other anime and reading manga, as well as discovering a new form of entertainment. </p>
